Face Recognition Webcam Security System
This project demonstrates a face recognition security system using a webcam. It detects faces in live video streams and matches them with known faces to determine if they are authorized users or intruders.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
face_recognition
opencv-python
numpy
websocket-client
You can install the required Python packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy websocket-client
Setup
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
Place images of authorized users in the same directory as the script (User1.jpg, User2.jpg, etc.).
Usage
Run the face_recognition_webcam.py script.
The webcam will activate, and faces will be detected in the live video stream.
If a recognized face is detected, the system will send an "off" command to an ESP32 device via WebSocket.
If an unrecognized face (intruder) is detected, the system will send an "on" command to the ESP32 device.
Press 'q' to quit the program.
WebSocket Setup
Ensure you have an ESP32 device with WebSocket support.
Replace websocket_url variable in the script with your ESP32 WebSocket server URL.
Notes
This demo processes every other frame of video to save processing time.
The system is set up to toggle a security mechanism (like a buzzer or light) connected to an ESP32 device when an intruder is detected.
